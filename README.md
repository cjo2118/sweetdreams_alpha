Chrome extension that allows users to add filters to their twitter feed

After seeing so many debates about the use of trigger warnings, I wanted to provide an alternative solution 
for people who want to filter out certain content on their social media pages. 

This version is a proof of concept for twitter, since twitter doesn't allow users to hide posts without unfollowing. 

Here is a demo of the extension:

**1. Add filters in the popup window, see them displayed at the bottom of the popup**

**2. Tweets containing filtered words are hidden**

**3. Remove filters by clicking them in the popup**
